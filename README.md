# Jenkins Pipeline Setup for Continuous Integration and Deployment

## Overview

This document outlines the setup of a Jenkins pipeline for Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) with GitHub integration. The pipeline consists of several stages to build, test, analyze, secure, deploy, and notify about the application status.

## Jenkinsfile Pipeline

### Pipeline Stages

1. **Build**
   - **Description:** Compile and package the code using a build automation tool.
   - **Tool:** You can use tools like Maven, Gradle, or a custom build script.
   - **Jenkinsfile Code:**
     ```groovy
     stage('Build') {
         steps {
             script {
                 echo 'Building the application...'
                 sh 'echo Building the application...'
             }
         }
     }
     ```

2. **Unit and Integration Tests**
   - **Description:** Run unit tests to ensure individual components work as expected and integration tests to ensure components work together.
   - **Tool:** `pytest` for Python applications.
   - **Jenkinsfile Code:**
     ```groovy
     stage('Unit and Integration Tests') {
         steps {
             script {
                 echo 'Running unit and integration tests...'
                 sh 'pytest'
             }
         }
     }
     ```

3. **Code Analysis**
   - **Description:** Analyze code to ensure it meets industry standards and is free of errors.
   - **Tool:** `pylint` for Python code analysis.
   - **Jenkinsfile Code:**
     ```groovy
     stage('Code Analysis') {
         steps {
             script {
                 echo 'Analyzing code with pylint...'
                 sh 'pylint app.py test_app.py'
             }
         }
     }
     ```

4. **Security Scan**
   - **Description:** Perform a security scan to identify vulnerabilities in the code.
   - **Tool:** `bandit` for security scanning in Python applications.
   - **Jenkinsfile Code:**
     ```groovy
     stage('Security Scan') {
         steps {
             script {
                 echo 'Performing security scan with bandit...'
                 sh 'bandit -r app.py'
             }
         }
     }
     ```

5. **Deploy to Staging**
   - **Description:** Deploy the application to a staging server for further testing.
   - **Tool:** SCP or other deployment tools.
   - **Jenkinsfile Code:**
     ```groovy
     stage('Deploy to Staging') {
         steps {
             script {
                 echo 'Deploying to staging environment...'
                 sh 'scp -r * user@staging-server:/path/to/staging'
             }
         }
     }
     ```

6. **Integration Tests on Staging**
   - **Description:** Run integration tests in the staging environment to ensure the application works as expected in a production-like environment.
   - **Tool:** `pytest` with staging configuration.
   - **Jenkinsfile Code:**
     ```groovy
     stage('Integration Tests on Staging') {
         steps {
             script {
                 echo 'Running integration tests on staging...'
                 sh 'pytest --staging'
             }
         }
     }
     ```

7. **Deploy to Production**
   - **Description:** Deploy the application to a production server.
   - **Tool:** SCP or other deployment tools.
   - **Jenkinsfile Code:**
     ```groovy
     stage('Deploy to Production') {
         steps {
             script {
                 echo 'Deploying to production environment...'
                 sh 'scp -r * user@production-server:/path/to/production'
             }
         }
     }
     ```

### Email Notifications

**Using the Email Extension Plugin**

- **Plugin Installation:** Install the Email Extension Plugin from the Jenkins plugin manager.
- **Configuration:** Use the `emailext` step for sending email notifications with attachments.

**Jenkinsfile Code:**
```groovy
post {
    always {
        emailext to: "${EMAIL_RECIPIENT}",
                 subject: "Jenkins Pipeline Status",
                 body: """\
The Jenkins pipeline has finished executing. 
Here are the details:
- Build Status: ${currentBuild.result}
- Logs: See the attached logs.
                 """,
                 attachmentsPattern: '**/*.log',
                 compress: true
    }
    success {
        echo 'Pipeline completed successfully.'
    }
    failure {
        echo 'Pipeline failed.'
        emailext to: "${EMAIL_RECIPIENT}",
                 subject: "Jenkins Pipeline Failed",
                 body: """\
The Jenkins pipeline has failed. 
Here are the details:
- Build Status: ${currentBuild.result}
- Logs: See the attached logs.
                 """,
                 attachmentsPattern: '**/*.log',
                 compress: true
    }
}
